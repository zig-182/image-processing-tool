# Image Processing Tool

## Overview
I created a Python script that utilizes PIL (Python Imaging Library) to automatically process a group of 10 images. This was my first time to write a script that automated a process.

## Languages

*	Python

## Brief Notes

The first script I wrote converted a group of .jpg images to .png images. There were several stages I had to complete before I was able to achieve this including:

* Identifying which library was the most suitable to use
* Creating a loop to go through each file in the original directory
* Fixing bugs such as my file initially including both the .png and .jpg file extensions
* I then explored what other features were included in PIL and slightly modified my script to automate two additional features

One of the main reasons I chose to learn Python was because I wanted to be able to automate processes that would be difficult (maybe impossible) to do manually. In my previous job experience, I feel this is the skill I most needed to acquire to be able to contribute more meaningfully to my team. Iâ€™m looking forward to being able to automate more tasks in the future.
